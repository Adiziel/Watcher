# Watcher
### Watcher is a simple discord bot built using discord.py. It is made to be added in text channels used as an album.

## What it does?
Mainly it watches messages and perform stuff as follows:

- If some member enter text or text with attachment bot will delete it immediately.
- only text member can send in channel is "\help watcher".
- if any attachment(s) gets uploaded by members it'll add a timestamp with date and time.

These are few stuff this bot does for now, many new features will be added in future.
